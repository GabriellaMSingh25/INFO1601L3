			<h1>Sample Poem</h1>
			<h2>The Road Not Taken - Robert Frost</h2>
			<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
				And sorry I could not travel both
				And be one traveler, long I stood
				And looked down one as far as I could
				To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
			<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
				And having perhaps the better claim,
				Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
				Though as for that the passing there
				Had worn them really about the same,</p>
			<p>
				And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
			</p>
			<p>
				I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
